<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
  Meal Planner is a project, which main purpose is to help creating a weekly schedule of meals, generate ingridient and shooping lists.


### Built With
The website will be created with:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

A REST API will be made with Express.js in Node.js.
Both apps will be deployed using [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and *mongoDB* database in the cloud.


## Usage
The idea is simple. Once on a website, one creates an account. On the first log in there is a bunch of data to collect, like allergies, preferences, number of meals per day. There will be a possibility to create a group of peaple with shared meal plan (e.g. family or roommates).
Once an account is created, all it takes is e.g. once a week generate a plan for whole group. Then print autogenerated shopping list and go to shop only once a week. An incredible savings in both time and money.
Developing project more, I want to add a possibility to calculate meal portions adequate to age / weight / goal (gain or lose weight) / etc.
